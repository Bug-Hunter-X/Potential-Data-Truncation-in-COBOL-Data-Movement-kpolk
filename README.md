This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs: data truncation during data movement. The `bug.cob` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a robust solution.  The error occurs when a larger data string is moved into a field with a smaller defined size, leading to unexpected behavior and potential data loss. The solution involves adding checks to ensure the length of the data is not more than the length of the target field. This solution illustrates the importance of rigorous data validation and error handling in COBOL to ensure program stability and correctness.
